Fiona's Personal Website
======
Thank's for visiting my website! This site is currently under development. Please check back soon for more content.

**About Me:**
Hello and thank you for visiting my website! I'm Fiona, a Ph.D. candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University, advised by Dr. Li Li. I expect to graduate in Summer 2027.

My research focus involves investigating how land use changes - such as deforestation, forest regeneration, and urbanization - alter hydrological flow paths and biogeochemical processes that affect stream water quality. I use a combination of **reactive transport modeling, high-resolution sensor data**, and **machine learning approaches** to explore the mechanisms and predictability of water quality responses. This work spans from understanding dissolved carbon dynamics in forested catchments to predicting eutrophication risks using deep learning models, offering a view of land use-water quality interactions under current and future conditions.


**Education:**
- **Ph.D.** in Civil and Environmental Engineering, *The Pennsylvania State University* (Expected 2027)
- **B.S.** in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology & Natural Resources and the Environment, *University of Connecticut* (2022)

**Selected Publications:**
- Liu, F., Liu, F. S., Kerins, D., Ramesh, S., Sullivan, P. L., Billings, S. A., ... & Li, L. (2025). What Happens Below? Contrasting Subsurface Water and Dissolved Carbon Dynamics Beneath Young and Old Forests. Authorea Preprints.
